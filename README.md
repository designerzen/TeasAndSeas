# Teas&Seas
Teas and Seas is a tool that generates music from text input.

It was intended to analyse the sentiment of legal documents and present their content in a musical way.

It is trained using a custom AFINN list, which rates common words used in contracts with an integer between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). This means it could be trained to be used on any other writing style.

The tool is built using web technology and uses the Sentiment and Scribbletune Node.js modules.
